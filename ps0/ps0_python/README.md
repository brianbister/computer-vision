`Which looks more like what youâ€™d expect a monochrome image to look like? Would you expect a computer vision algorithm to work on one better than the other?`

It's difficult to say but the red channel looks more monochrome than the green. With the image I chose the red channel has more distinct edges, the green feels like there are several more shades of green in the picture which is why it feels like red may be better suited for computer vision algorithms. However, I feel these results may vary based on the contents of your image.
